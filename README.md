# 4-Band-Resistor-Color-Code-Calculator
This is a C code that takes the values of the band colors of a 4-band resistor from the user, and calculates what the resistance value and tolerance value are.

The program will prompt the user to enter a number for each band, and each band number corresponds to the equivalent band color found in resistors.

The Engineering Notation Converter was turned into a header file for this project, and made portable for future projects.
